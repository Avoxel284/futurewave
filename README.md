# Futurewave 2 osu! skin

All assets were created using Adobe Illustrator.
<br>
This skin was made for the normal osu! gamemode so compatibility with other gamemodes isn't guaranteed. Also, since my move to Windows, I have stopped creating a version for 16:10 screen ratios and so there is only support for 16:9.

Current version: `v2.4.4`
