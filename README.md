**Latest version: `v4.0.0` [Download skin](https://github.com/Avoxel284/futurewave/releases/download/v4.0.0/Futurewave.4.0.0.osk)**

All assets were created using Adobe Illustrator.
<br>
This skin was made for the normal osu! gamemode so compatibility with other gamemodes isn't guaranteed. Suitable for 16:9 displays, also doesn't contain any sounds.

Probably the last version of this skin.
