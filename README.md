# Futurewave 2 osu! skin

**Latest version: `v2.4.5` [Download skin](https://github.com/Avoxel284/futurewave/releases/download/v2.4.5/Futurewave.2.4.5.osk)**

All assets were created using Adobe Illustrator.
<br>
This skin was made for the normal osu! gamemode so compatibility with other gamemodes isn't guaranteed. Also, since my move to Windows, I have stopped creating a version for 16:10 screen ratios and so there is only support for 16:9.
